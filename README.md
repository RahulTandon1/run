# run
aka 'the Slow Down Running Game'
## Using / Playing
download the file and run ```sgrt.py```

## backstory
A friend of mine called Shubhang (not on github) needed help with his CS Project. 
The aim was to make a python clone of dino run. 

We used the graphics.py module by John Zelle (https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py)

We made a circle the dino and the bullet the trees. Press 'space' to jump. Simple. 

## Problems (not in order or priority)
There's 2-3 problems.
 - The bullet slows down when the player jumps. I think correcting this would require concurrency, 
 and given that I'm too lazy to learn it right now, I'm calling it a feature lol. 
 
 - The logic for the ```touches``` function (used to detect if the player and obstacle are in contact) in the ```sgrt.py``` file needs to be improved since it's buggy rn. 
 
 - Readibility and style (structure) need to improved.
 
 - Need to increase the speed of the bullet with time. 

## Conclusion
Well, I made this in 3 days with a basic understanding of Python (only done it in/for school) and it's for somebody else so i'm fine with leaving it the way it is. I MIGHT decide to pick it up if learning concurrency or i just might use another project idea. IDK
 
Anyway, I've got a Physics test I've been procastinating studying for and I've practically got to do a year's syllabus. 

GTG BYE!
